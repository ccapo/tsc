This is the repository for my roleplaying rogue-like game: The Sepertine Caves

The game is still in early development, but I hope to have a fully functioning
version in the near future.

The game is playable, but many of the components have not been implemented,
most notably the final boss. Also, the monsters can't attack you.

The game should compile under 32-bit and 64-bit Linux distributions, with the
audio library FMOD working under both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
