This is the repository for my roleplaying rogue-like game: The Sepertine Caves

The game is still in early development, but I hope to have a fully functioning
version in the near future.

The game is playable, but many of the components have not been implemented,
most notably the final boss. Also, the monsters can't attack you.

The game should compile under 32 and 64-bit Linux distributions, but
unfortunately the audio library still only works under 32-bit systems.

Furthermore, the executable file compressor UPX included in this repository
currently only works under 32-bit Linux distributions and Windows. So if
attempting to compile under a 64-bit Linux system, it'll be necessary to
comment out its usage in the Makefile.
